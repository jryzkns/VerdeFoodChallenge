## What does this app do?

This app aims to help residents of Metro Vancouver collectively reduce green house gas emissions by changing their diet.
Many necessities for living nowadays produce greenhouse gases, 
a significant type of which are classified as Carbon Dioxide eqivalents (CO2e).

## Why make this app?

-Food is generally under-reported as a source of CO2e. For instance in Europe, agriculture contributes to 10% of the total carbon footprint. 
-In particular, some animals produce methane and therefore more CO2e than other animals.
-In this app, people will learn how much their diet produces in terms of CO2e, and discover how much CO2e they could save by exploring new options.

## Platform

- Android devices with API level `21` and `28`
